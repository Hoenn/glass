What layers need to be to have a working TMX file
In top to bottom order
"Walls"
"PickUps"
"Boundry"
"Floor"

Boundry and Floor are cosmetic layers that aren't intrepreted
by the game and are just displayed. Program will crash if "Walls" and
"PickUps" are present and spelled exactly as written as it is specifically
searching for those layers to make colliding walls and to generate pick ups.

Floor layer must be drawn specially. To avoid visual tearing Floor tiles 
must be padded at least 1 pixel in all directions, and the tile itself needs
to have an offset to center it for drawing. The idea is to have a 22 by 22 picture
inside a 20 by 20 tile so that it's edges overlap with other floor tiles and
the "space" between the tiles that has issues rendering will be colored the same
color as the nearest pixel to each floor tile.
